### Warlock Pact
As a warlock your spellcasting ability is granted to you by a patron whom you 
have made a magically binding pact with. You may attempt to commune with them
your GM allows, and you MUST obey ANY demands your patron asks of you, or they
may consider taking back your magic. Choose one patron from the following and
refer to the end of this document for what the benefits of each are.

- Devil
- Demon
- Celestial

### Pact Casting
You are capable of casting spells thanks to your otherworldy pact. Your casting
modifier for these spells is charisma. when a spell refers to a saving throw the
DC is 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Charisma Modifier. At level 1 you learn
3 cantrips from the warlock spell list and each level after that you learn one
leveled spell of your maximum spell level or lower. 

Your body is incapable of properly containing all the magical ability of your 
patron, putting you at risk of corruption when you cast leveled spells. When you 
cast a spell that does not require a spell attack, roll 1d20. If the spell you 
cast refers to a spell attack, simply use the natural roll of the attack rather 
than rolling another 20 sided die. if the roll is less than or equal to 2 + the 
level of the spell, then roll a 1d2. On a 1, roll on the "Bad Corruptions" 
chart. On a 2, roll on the "Minor Detrimental Corruptions" chart. For all 
casting except cantrips a natural 1 is an automatic roll on the 
"Bad Corruptions" chart. If you roll below the threshold and are corrupted you 
may instead drop to 1 hitpoint and attempt your d20 roll again, with there being 
no corruptive effect on a high enough roll.  

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d6 + your constitution modifier.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 3d6 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum 

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Invocations
Your patron offers you invocations to passively strengthen you or grant you
abilities that you would not have otherwise. Refer to the warlock invocations
column of the warlock level chart to determine how many invocations you should
have at a given level.
