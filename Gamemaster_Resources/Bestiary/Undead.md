```
Undead creatures are created by magical influence or the unyeilding spirits of
the dead or dying. Undead monsters are synonymous with disease and death, and 
often bring both.

### Skeletons
Skeletons are the undead remains of humanoids, often raised by an animate dead 
spell or similar magic. They lack eyes and so their vision is limitied, and they
more often than not lack the intelligence or bodily functions to speak. 
Skeletons who lack intelligence must perform the simple commands their creator 
gave them, meaning they will defend a doorway, but not a window, unless they are
told to defend both. Skeletons operate on precise to the word logic.
